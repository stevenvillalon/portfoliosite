# Projects

## [1. Histograms & Hoops](http://histogramsandhoops.streamlit.app)

During the Fall 2024 semester, I took courses in Probability & Statistics and Python programming. I wanted to come up with a project that would help me apply the concepts I was learning in both classes. In Statistics, we covered topics like histograms, probability distributions, and random variables. One day, while watching a basketball game with friends, I realized that the abundance of available basketball data would be a great resource to apply these techniques.

This app, built with Python and Streamlit, uses data from the NBA API, and focuses on box scores for all players in the 2023-2024 NBA season. It allows users to explore histograms of various player statistics and also estimate the probability of a player reaching a specific performance threshold, like scoring 30 points in a game. In a future version, I plan to expand the app by adding more variables and using regression models to improve prediction accuracy.

## 2. Coming Soon...

Next semester, I'll be diving into Linear Models and Introduction to Machine Learning, so a new project is on the horizon. Stay tuned!
